--In this SQL code using the SSMS syntax style, I am querying a database that holds Finance data to answer questions about the data.
--The data is publicly accessible at https://techavilly.net/download-data/



--To view the table to get familiar with the dataset, I ran this query;

SELECT * FROM [dbo].['Finance data']



--How many transaction type are in the Finance data and what are their corresponding total amounts.

SELECT Distinct [type], ROUND(SUM([amount]),0) AS Total_Amount
FROM [dbo].['Finance data']
GROUP BY [type]
ORDER BY [type];



--Show a breakdown of all transaction types in percentage.

SELECT [type],ROUND(COUNT(*)* 100/ (SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM [dbo].['Finance data']),1) 
AS Total_Percent FROM [dbo].['Finance data']
WHERE [type] IN ('CASH_OUT','TRANSFER', 'CASH_IN', 'DEBIT', 'PAYMENT')
GROUP BY [type]



--What percentage of the total transaction amount is Cash_Out?

SELECT [type],Round(Sum([amount]) * 100/ (SELECT Sum([amount])
FROM [dbo].['Finance data']),1) AS percentage_of_Total
FROM [dbo].['Finance data']
WHERE [type]= 'CASH_OUT'
GROUP BY [type];



--What is the count of all the fraud transactions in the Finance Data?

SELECT [type],count(*) AS Fraud_Transactions 
FROM [dbo].['Finance data']
WHERE [isFraud] = 1
GROUP BY [type]



--Show the total amount of each transaction type, as well as the percenatage breakdown.

SELECT [type], ROUND(SUM([amount]),0) AS TotalAmount
FROM [dbo].['Finance data']
GROUP BY [type]

SELECT [type],Round(sum([amount])* 100/ (SELECT sum([amount])
FROM [dbo].['Finance data']),1) 
AS Total FROM[dbo].['Finance data']
GROUP BY [type]



--What is the total count of payment transaction in the Finance Data?

SELECT [type], COUNT(*) AS Total_Count 
FROM [dbo].['Finance data']
WHERE [type] = 'PAYMENT'
GROUP BY [type]



--Show all the types of transactions greater than $2000,000, display only the type and the amount 

SELECT TOP 1000 [type], [amount]
FROM [dbo].['Finance data'] 
WHERE ([amount]>2000000) 
ORDER BY [amount] DESC
