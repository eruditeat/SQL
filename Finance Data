--In this SQL code using the SSMS syntax style, I am querying a database that holds Finance data to answer questions about the data.
--The data is publicly accessible at https://techavilly.net/download-data/



--To view the table to get familiar with the dataset, I ran this query;

SELECT * FROM [dbo].['Finance data']



--How many transaction type are in the Finance data and what are their corresponding total amounts.

SELECT Distinct [type], ROUND(SUM([amount]),0) AS Total_Amount
FROM [dbo].['Finance data']
GROUP BY [type]
ORDER BY [type];



--Show a breakdown of all transaction types in percentage.

SELECT [type],ROUND(COUNT(*)* 100/ (SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM [dbo].['Finance data']),1) 
AS Total_Percent FROM [dbo].['Finance data']
WHERE [type] IN ('CASH_OUT','TRANSFER', 'CASH_IN', 'DEBIT', 'PAYMENT')
GROUP BY [type]
